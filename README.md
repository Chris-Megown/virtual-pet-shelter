The project virtual-pet-shelter contains 3 classes. The NewVirtualPet class is responsable for constructing pets, holding their distinct values and calling methods upon individual pets.  The VirtualPetShelter class is responsable for creating a Map and storing pets within it.  This class will also use a Collection of the sheltered pets to call upon when needing to use methods on all the current pets in the Map.  The final class is the VirtualPetApp where all the information is displayed out to the console and where the users input is collected to be used.

In this App you can adopt pets out of the pet shelter, admit new pets into the shelter, and care for you pets (i.e feed, hydrate, play with).  If you neglect your pets the App will let you know and remove them if necessary.
